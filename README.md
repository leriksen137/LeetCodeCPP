# LeetCodeCPP
In this repository I upload my solutions for the (May LeetCoding Challenge)[https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/]

My leetcode profile can be found (here)[https://leetcode.com/leriksen/]

For each problem I include a $(ProblemName).cpp which includes the solution I submitted to LeetCode. Additionally, I include a $(ProblemName)Tests.cpp with (catch2)[https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2] unit tests.

# TODO
Once the month of may is complete, I will also use this project to get experience with a few other subjects:
* Static Analysis
* CMake
* Precompiled Headers
